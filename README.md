# Sublime 3: Direct Edit plugin

config the file path that you frequently have to edit, then you can hit `ctrl+shift+o` to directly open them and edit


##Installation

- Use package control: search `DirectEdit` and install
- Clone the source code into your sublime text's package folder

##Configuration

It's simple, there is only one available config field for now, the `file` field. You give it a `title` and `location`, then it's available in the selection panel when you hit `ctrl+shift+o`.

##Thanks

Many thanks to the [SublimeHostsEdit][hostsEdit]'s author, it inspired me to create this plugins. Actually this plugins is simply a extended version of `SublimeHostsEdit`, and I refered to it a lot when begining my path of learning python and sublime plugin development.

##Todo

- toggle comment
- auto-focus after open file
